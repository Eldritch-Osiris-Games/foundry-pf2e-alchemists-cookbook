Choose a bomb you are wielding to destroy then choose another bomb you are wielding in another hand. That bomb gains a status bonus to damage based on the type of bomb destroyed. The bonus damage is 1 for a lesser bomb, 2 for a moderate bomb, 3 for a greater bomb, or 4 for a major bomb. This additional damage is the same type of damage that the destroyed bomb would normally deal. This process makes the explosive unstable, and causes the bomb to lose its potency at the end of your turn.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.XN9iw4pkSEbxciKB]{Hasty Tosses} Feat 8</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Grenadier Dedication</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have both hands free</p><hr /><p>You are able to very quickly, if not haphazardly, throw out bombs from your person.

If a creature rolls a success (but not a critical success) against the initial exposure to any of 16 suffers half of the stage 1 damage. They do not suffer any additional effects or conditions of the poison, and do not progress to stage 1, as normal for rolling a success against an exposure of an injury poison.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.nDrB2r6aNr1Ecgry]{Preparations} Feat 8</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are afflicted with a poison.</p><hr /><p>You use fire to beat fire.

Choose a bomb you are wielding to destroy then choose another bomb you are wielding in another hand. That bomb gains a status bonus to damage based on the type of bomb destroyed. The bonus damage is 1 for a lesser bomb, 2 for a moderate bomb, 3 for a greater bomb, or 4 for a major bomb. This additional damage is the same type of damage that the destroyed bomb would normally deal. This process makes the explosive unstable, and causes the bomb to lose its potency at the end of your turn.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.XN9iw4pkSEbxciKB]{Hasty Tosses} Feat 8</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Grenadier Dedication</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have both hands free</p><hr /><p>You are able to very quickly, if not haphazardly, throw out bombs from your person.

You use Quick Bomber a number of times equal to the number of actions you use to perform this activity, but the Strikes made must be against different targets within your first range increment, and each Strike suffers a -2 circumstance penalty. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but you do not increase your multiple attack penalty until you have made all of your attacks.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.W95OlPE0zMVt6Ayo]{I'm Taking You With Me} Feat 16</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Grenadier Dedication</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have at least 3 bombs stowed or in your hands</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per day</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> You suffer a critical hit, or you are reduced to 0 HP</p><hr /><p>You have rigged yourself with explosives as a final contingency for victory. Once the trigger has been met, you may use your reaction to cause 3 bombs of your choice on your person explode. Every creature within a 20 foot burst centered on you must make a basic Reflex save against your class DC. You automatically fail your saving throw. The blast deals 16d6 damage of a type of your choice out of the damage types of the three bombs.</p></details><h2>Poisonmonger</h2><p><em><strong>Uncommon</strong></em></p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-class-features.KdZ3AsgltwA4yGAr]{Poisonous Obsession (Poisonmonger)} Feature 1</h3><p><em>Whether because you are deranged or professionally discrete, few match the mastery of poisons like a poisonmonger.</em></p><p>You must select the @UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.fITYQQLwVSvlt1o4]{Poisonmonger Dedication} as your 2nd level class feat.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You must be an alchemist with the toxicologist research field.</p><p><strong>Poisonmonger Adjustments</strong> Whenever you use @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.yzNJgwzV9XqEhKc6]{Quick Alchemy} to create an alchemical poison, you may apply it to a weapon that you are holding as a free action. In addition, any poison you make using Quick Alchemy loses its potency at the end of your next turn. However, due to your focus on poisons, your knowledge of other fields of alchemy is lacking. You become trained in martial weapons, and whenever your proficiency in simple weapons increases, so does your proficiency in martial weapons. Whenever you use @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Pe0zmIqyTBc2Td0I]{Advanced Alchemy} to create an item that is not an alchemical poison, you only create one item instead of a batch of two.

Your strikes with any weapon in the knife group can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature's resistance. In addition, If you critically succeed at an attack roll using a weapon in the knife weapon group you've poisoned and the target rolls a failure on the poison's initial save, the target critically fails instead.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.og3QS0SRpVbo9530]{Alchemical Breadth} Feat 4</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><hr /><p>Choose bomb trait, elixir trait (non-mutagen trait), mutagen trait, or alchemical tools when you select this feat.

If a creature rolls a success (but not a critical success) against the initial exposure to any of 16 suffers half of the stage 1 damage. They do not suffer any additional effects or conditions of the poison, and do not progress to stage 1, as normal for rolling a success against an exposure of an injury poison.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.nDrB2r6aNr1Ecgry]{Preparations} Feat 8</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are afflicted with a poison.</p><hr /><p>You use fire to beat fire. You drink one of your infused poisons with the ingested trait that you are either holding or have stowed.

Whenever you deal bludgeoning damage with a weapon that is coated in an injury poison, the target is exposed to that poison even if the attack does not deal slashing or piercing damage. You also gain the Poison Resistance (Core Rulebook) class feat.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can’t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the poisonmonger archetype.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.bh76BFaiDEViLyEg]{Doped Knives} Feat 4</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><hr /><p>Your poisons, when used with small blades, are potent enough to expose on the most minor of grazes. Your strikes with any weapon in the knife group can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature's resistance. In addition, If you critically succeed at an attack roll using a weapon in the knife weapon group you've poisoned and the target rolls a failure on the poison's initial save, the target critically fails instead.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.og3QS0SRpVbo9530]{Alchemical Breadth} Feat 4</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><hr /><p>Choose bomb trait, elixir trait (non-mutagen trait), mutagen trait, or alchemical tools when you select this feat.

If a creature rolls a success (but not a critical success) against the initial exposure to any of 16 suffers half of the stage 1 damage. They do not suffer any additional effects or conditions of the poison, and do not progress to stage 1, as normal for rolling a success against an exposure of an injury poison.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.nDrB2r6aNr1Ecgry]{Preparations} Feat 8</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are afflicted with a poison.</p><hr /><p>You use fire to beat fire. You drink one of your infused poisons with the ingested trait that you are either holding or have stowed. The poison attempts to counteract your affliction, using your class DC - 10 as its counteract modifier. Regardless of the result, you are not exposed to your ingested poison.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.MYQCdHix2BZAjJMg]{Advanced Breakthrough} Feat 12</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Alchemical Breadth</p><p>Your knowledge of alchemy grows ever more vast, allowing you to branch out your specialty. Whenever you use advanced alchemy to create an item of the type you chose for Alchemical Breadth, you can make a batch of 2 of that item for each infused reagent. Whenever you use advanced alchemy in this way, treat your advanced alchemy level as 3 levels lower.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.FQfRurqbyr5xttRx]{Explosive Toxicant} Feat 12</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical poison, and that poison's level is at least 3 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.</p><hr /><p>You warp the catalysts and accelerate reactions within a poison to make it volatile. Your poison becomes a bomb that deals 1d4 poison damage on a hit, and 1 poison splash damage.

In addition, any poison you make using Quick Alchemy loses its potency at the end of your next turn. However, due to your focus on poisons, your knowledge of other fields of alchemy is lacking. You become trained in martial weapons, and whenever your proficiency in simple weapons increases, so does your proficiency in martial weapons. Whenever you use @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Pe0zmIqyTBc2Td0I]{Advanced Alchemy} to create an item that is not an alchemical poison, you only create one item instead of a batch of two.

Whenever you deal bludgeoning damage with a weapon that is coated in an injury poison, the target is exposed to that poison even if the attack does not deal slashing or piercing damage. You also gain the Poison Resistance (Core Rulebook) class feat.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can’t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the poisonmonger archetype.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.bh76BFaiDEViLyEg]{Doped Knives} Feat 4</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><hr /><p>Your poisons, when used with small blades, are potent enough to expose on the most minor of grazes. Your strikes with any weapon in the knife group can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature's resistance. In addition, If you critically succeed at an attack roll using a weapon in the knife weapon group you've poisoned and the target rolls a failure on the poison's initial save, the target critically fails instead.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.og3QS0SRpVbo9530]{Alchemical Breadth} Feat 4</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><hr /><p>Choose bomb trait, elixir trait (non-mutagen trait), mutagen trait, or alchemical tools when you select this feat.

You swap out the poison's contact trait with the injury trait, and the poison no longer has an onset time. However, this poison is only potent until the start of your next turn.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.YhVTSRySkEKsWlaR]{Reliable Poisons} Feat 8</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><hr /><p>A creature may be able to resist your poisons, but it always leaves a mark. If a creature rolls a success (but not a critical success) against the initial exposure to any of 16 suffers half of the stage 1 damage. They do not suffer any additional effects or conditions of the poison, and do not progress to stage 1, as normal for rolling a success against an exposure of an injury poison.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.nDrB2r6aNr1Ecgry]{Preparations} Feat 8</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Poisonmonger Dedication</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are afflicted with a poison.</p><hr /><p>You use fire to beat fire. You drink one of your infused poisons with the ingested trait that you are either holding or have stowed. The poison attempts to counteract your affliction, using your class DC - 10 as its counteract modifier. Regardless of the result, you are not exposed to your ingested poison.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-feats.MYQCdHix2BZAjJMg]{Advanced Breakthrough} Feat 12</h3><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Alchemical Breadth</p><p>Your knowledge of alchemy grows ever more vast, allowing you to branch out your specialty. Whenever you use advanced alchemy to create an item of the type you chose for Alchemical Breadth, you can make a batch of 2 of that item for each infused reagent.

Your poison becomes a bomb that deals 1d4 poison damage on a hit, and 1 poison splash damage. Any creature that takes the splash damage is exposed to the poison, regardless of its usual exposure requirements.</p></details>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":625000,"name":"Other","type":"text","_id":"HUlbKVaT40hCWa22","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2><strong>@UUID[Compendium.foundry-pf2e-alchemists-cookbook.alchemists-cookbook-familiar-abilities.9yozLZLTalvSwSrX]{Homunculus Familiar}</strong></h2><p><strong>Required Number of Abilities</strong> 2</p><p><strong>Granted Abilities</strong> independent</p><p>You have created a simple servant of clay, ash, and your own blood, granting it a deep link with you.
